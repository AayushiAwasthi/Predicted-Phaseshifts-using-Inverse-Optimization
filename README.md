README: Scattering Phase Shift Programs

How to Run the Program

This document provides step-by-step instructions for executing the Scattering Phase Shift Programs.

Steps to Execute:

Copy or write the provided code directly into Python Terminal, Spyder, or Jupyter Notebook.

Save the file with a .py extension.

Execute the code using the function key 'F5'. This will automatically save and run the program.

A figure window displaying the required plots will appear.

Execution Instructions:

For Doublet State of Neutron-Deuteron (nd) Scattering:

Uncomment the Energy and Phase Shift data corresponding to the doublet state.

Uncomment the potential parameters for l = 0.

Run the program using 'F5'.

For Quartet State of Neutron-Deuteron (nd) Scattering:

Comment out the doublet state data.

Uncomment the Energy and Phase Shift data for the quartet state.

Run the program using 'F5'.

By following these steps, you can successfully execute the scattering phase shift analysis for different states.
